### What's new in WeView?

* WeView is a near-total rewrite, that should be more consistent and better handle edge cases such
  as degenerate layouts.
* WeView uses a category and associated objects to hang layout properties on any existing UIView,
  removing the need for subclassing, implementing a protocol, etc.  This makes WeView far easier to
  use.
* WeView has a new cell-based layout model that is easier to understand.
* WeView should be more consistent and better handle edge cases such as degenerate layouts.
* WeView offers a number of new per-view properties that allow more fine-grained control over 
   layout behavior.
