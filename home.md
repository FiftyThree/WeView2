The WeView library is a tool for auto layout of iOS UIs. 

* WeView is an alternative to [iOS Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html).
* WeView aims to provide an _easier, more natural, more expressive, and more maintainable_ way to create _dynamic, adaptive UIs_ with UIKit.
* WeView takes a _declarative_ approach to layout using familiar concepts like _alignment_, _margins_ and _spacing_. 
* WeView builds on iOS' existing sizing and layout mechanisms.  
* WeView is _lightweight_: less than 5k lines of code, no dependencies.
* WeView is compatible with _iOS 5 and later_. 
* WeView is _free_ and _open source_. It is available under a [permissive license](License.html).
* WeView is _well-documented_. The _[project pages](http://charlesmchen.github.io/WeView2/)_ include extensive tutorials and examples and the repo includes a demo app with an interactive sandbox.
