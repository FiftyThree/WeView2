The WeView library is a tool for auto layout of iOS UIs. 

* WeView is an alternative to [iOS' built-in Auto Layout Mechanism](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html).
* WeView's goal is provide an _easier, more natural, more expressive, and more maintainable_ way to create _dynamic, adaptive UIs_ with UIKit.
* WeView builds on iOS' existing sizing and layout mechanisms.  WeView is _compatible_ with any properly implemented UIViews without any modifications.
* WeView is _lightweight_: less than 5k lines of code, no dependencies.
* WeView is compatible with _iOS 5 and later_.
* WeView is available under a [permissive license](License.html).
