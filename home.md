<!-- TEMPLATE START -->

The WeView library is a tool for auto layout of iOS UIs. 

* WeView is an alternative to [iOS's built-in Auto Layout Mechanism](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html).
* WeView builds on iOS's existing sizing and layout mechanisms.  WeView is compatible with any properly implemented UIViews without any modifications.
* WeView draws on the concepts and vocabulary used by HTML and CSS layout (ie. margins, spacing, alignment, etc.).
* WeView takes advantage of ARC and blocks and is compatible with iOS 5 and later.
* WeView is available under a permissive license (see below).
