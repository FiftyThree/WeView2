* __Q: Does WeView support sub-pixel layout?__

__No.__  Many UIViews (ie. UILabels) don't render properly if they are not pixel-aligned.  WeView goes a step further and only supports point-alignment ( _not_ pixel-alignment).  This simplifies the development process by ensuring that layouts are consistent on retina and non-retina devices.
