Why use Auto Layout?
==

<!-- TEMPLATE START -->

Auto layout allows a UI to...

* Adapt to different screen sizes (ie. the iPhone 5 vs. other iPhones) (be responsive).
* Adapt to orientation changes.
* Adapt to design changes (ie. a larger font size, addition another subview, change of image size, etc.).
* Adapt to textual changes as your UI is translated into other languages.
* Adapt to dynamic content, ie. displaying content downloaded from the network.

This becomes even more important with iOS 7, which allows users to adjust text sizes outside of your app.
