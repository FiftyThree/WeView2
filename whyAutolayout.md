Why use Auto Layout?
==

<!-- TEMPLATE START -->

Auto layout allows a UI to...

* Adapt to different screen sizes (ie. the iPhone 5 vs. other iPhones) (be responsive).
* Adapt to orientation changes.
* Adapt to design changes (ie. change of font size).
* Adapt to textual changes as your UI is translated into other languages.
* Adapt to dynamic content.

This becomes even more important with iOS 7, which lets users adjust text sizes outside of your app.
