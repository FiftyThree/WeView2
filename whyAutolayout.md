Why use Auto Layout?
==

<!-- TEMPLATE START -->

Auto layout allows a UI to...

* Adapt to different screen sizes (ie. the iPhone 5 vs. other iPhones).
* Adapt to orientation changes.
* Adapt to design changes (ie. changing font size, adding or removing another subview, changing image size, etc.).
* Adapt to textual changes as your UI is translated into other languages.
* Adapt to dynamic content, ie. displaying content downloaded from the network.

This becomes even more important with _iOS 7_, which allows users to adjust text sizes outside of your app.
