Design Philosophy
==

<!-- TEMPLATE START -->

* _Strive to be lightweight_. Stay focused on solving a single problem. Add no third-party dependencies. Play nicely with other layout mechanisms. Leverage existing understanding of HTML and CSS: container-driven, declarative layout.
* _Lower the learning curve_.  Keep the barrier to entry low and ensure that the library is easy to master through conceptual simplicity, comments and documentation.
* _Focus on maintainability_. Bend over backwards to allow users to write terse, readable code.  Avoid boilerplate by providing convenience accessors and factory methods. Enable chaining by having all setters and configuration methods return a reference to the receiver. 
* _Optimize around the common case_. Ground the design in classic use cases. On the other hand, make no assumptions and support unanticipated usage by being extensible.
* _Prioritize developer time_. Provide convenience accessors, factory methods etc. to make common tasks easier. 
* _Keep it simple_. WeView v2's design embraces simplicity so that it is easy to understand and work with. When in doubt, leave it out.
* _Leverage XCode_. Take advantage of XCode's autocomplete.

And especially: Use a _Documentation-Driven Design_ process

* A good design is easy to understand.  
* A design that easy to understand should be easy to explain using plain language.  
* It is easier to spot complexity in the documentation than in the code. 
* Write the documentation as you design the API.  
* Whenever the documentation becomes complicated or involved, revisit the design.
