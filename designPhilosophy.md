Design Philosophy
==

<!-- TEMPLATE START -->

* _Strive to be lightweight_. Stay focused on solving a single problem. Add no third-party dependencies. Play nicely with other layout mechanisms. Leverage existing understanding of HTML and CSS: container-driven, declarative layout.
* _Lower the learning curve_.  Keep the barrier to entry low and ensure that the library is easy to master through conceptual simplicity, comments and documentation.
* _Focus on maintainability_. Bend over backwards to allow users to write terse, readable code.  Avoid boilerplate by providing convenience accessors and factory methods. Enable chaining by having all setters and configuration methods return a reference to the receiver. 
* _Prioritize developer time_. Provide convenience accessors, factory methods etc. to make common tasks easier. 
* _Keep it simple_. WeView 2's design embraces simplicity so that it is easy to understand and work with.
* _Leverage XCode_. Take advantage of XCode's autocomplete.
