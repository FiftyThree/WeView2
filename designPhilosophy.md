### Design philosophy

* Leverage existing understanding of HTML and CSS: container-driven, declarative layout.
* Strive to be lightweight. Stay focused on solving a single problem. Add no third-party dependencies. Play nicely with other layout mechanisms.
* Bend over backwards to allow users to write terse, readable code. 
* Avoid boilerplate by providing convenience accessors and factory methods.
* Enable chaining by having all setters and configuration methods return a reference to the receiver.
* Provide convenience accessors, factory methods etc. to make common tasks easier.
